# GCD.java

## Description

Contains functions that help the user find the greatest common divisor [GCD] of two integers.

This is done using a very specific implementation of the **Euclidean Algorithm** â€” which is an extremely efficient way of calculating the GCD without having to use complex computations nor prime factorization. The calculations used in this Java program are ultimately very straight-forward, but contains well-formatted, human-readable code featuring glanceable in-line comments and a flawless programming style.

### `int` `Euclidean()`
- Takes two arguments: int `a`, int `b`
- Returns the greatest common divisor of the two integers passed into this method.

### `int[]` `ModifiedEuclidean()`
- Takes two arguments: int `A`, int `B`
- Returns an **array** containing the information needed to calculate the GCD of two integers.
